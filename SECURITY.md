## Security Design

The Paperclip Operator is built with security as a primary concern:

- **Non-root execution**: All containers run as non-root (UID 1000/65532)
- **Dropped capabilities**: All Linux capabilities are dropped by default
- **Seccomp profiles**: RuntimeDefault seccomp profile enabled
- **NetworkPolicies**: Default-deny with selective allowlisting
- **RBAC**: Least-privilege roles per instance
- **Distroless base image**: Minimal attack surface for the operator container
- **Container signing**: Release images are signed with Cosign
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials generated for each release
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated via Dependabot and Trivy
